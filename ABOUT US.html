    We are a group of students  that want to help our school
    community, specially to all the freshman students that 
    can be confused in the courses that they are learning.
    This is why we bring digital lessons and articles with 
    the most important topics they should know, with clearance 
    experience and creativity, for making them to familiarize 
    with the information and ultimately, interested in it.
